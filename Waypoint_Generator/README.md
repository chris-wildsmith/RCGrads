# Waypoint Generator

This is the tool that was used to generate the waypoint file which the tactical processor would use in its calculations of the path to follow.

This tool would use an still image from the overhead camera so that you can see where you are plotting the coordinates. There are a number of configuration settings that can be made on the different waypoints.
The tool will then generate the waypoints into a file that can be dropped onto the tactical processor.
